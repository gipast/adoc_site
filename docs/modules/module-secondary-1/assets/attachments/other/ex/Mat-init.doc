The purpose of the program Mat-init.exe is to write INITIAL statements for a

GPSS/PC matrix savevalue (one INITIAL statement per line).  Matrix values must

be entered in a row-wise manner.  However, values must be separated by one or

more spaces.  The values are restricted to the range -32768 to +32767.  Zero

values must be entered explicitly.  INITIAL statements are stored in an ASCII

file.  This file can be used to initialize a matrix savevalue by using

@filespec before invoking the START control statement.
