The purpose of the program Lnum-add is to add line numbers to a GPSS model so

that it can be used with GPSS/PC.  The GPSS model without line numbers must be

in an ASCII file and the model with line numbers will also be in an ASCII file.

The file names for the two GPSS models must be different.
