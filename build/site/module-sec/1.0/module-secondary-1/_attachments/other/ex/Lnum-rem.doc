The purpose of the program Lnum-rem.exe is to remove line numbers from a

GPSS/PC model so that it can be used with another version of GPSS.  The

GPSS/PC model must be in an ASCII file and the model without line numbers

will also be in an ASCII file. The file names for the two GPSS models must

be different. 


*Please note:  This program has been supplied by a user of GPSS/PC with
               the hope that it will be useful to other users.
	       It is supplied "as is" with no warranty of any kind.
